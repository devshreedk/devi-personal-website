            <h2>Dilemma - It's Twisted!</h2>

            <p>
                It is an anthology and I worked as a compiler with one of my friends.
                The dilemma means a situation in which we have to choose difficult choices
                between two or more alternatives and most of them are undesirable ones.
                In this anthology, 30+ co-authors penned their views and thoughts in the
                form of poems, articles, quotes, stories, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through this anthology, we tried to encourage people
                to express or share their feelings and experience and
                wants to know how they dealt with them.
